Though Text & Link Destiller application is closed source, during development we used lots of Open Source classes. To make programming more comfortably we developed a SEO orientated wrapper PHP class for most of them. We call this wrapper "DestillerToolSet" (shorthand: DTS) which is static class solving lots of recurring problems while working on web content.

In order to pay back to the community this package is a public release which is very helpfull in developing and programming semantic related web applications. Additionally a helper class DTHelper and a statistics class (DTStatistics) as well as an appropiate database component (MySQL, ADODB) called DTDatabase are provided.

Additionally DTS supports the MicroContentObjectModel and classes (textdatabase abstraction layer, bgHTTP) from BlooGee (see project links on this page).
